2025.03.15 note taking
1. will discuss about GitHub first, then Git
2. repository purpose: project-based folder
3. README.md will appear in the bottom section of folder (or subfolder)
4. subfolder can be created in file field following by a slash line, so GitHub will recognize it as a subfoler rather than a file
